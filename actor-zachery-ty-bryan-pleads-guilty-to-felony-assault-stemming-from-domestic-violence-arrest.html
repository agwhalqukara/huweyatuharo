I could’ve fought it . . . but that’s more stress and drama. I got two misdemeanors and called it a day.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The “Home Improvement” actor agreed to terms of a negotiated resolution, which dismisses the second count of felony assault. <span class=credit>FilmMagic</span></figure><p>Police said at the time that Bryan “assaulted the victim, impeded her breathing, and [took] the victim’s phone from her when she tried to call 911,” according to “E!
