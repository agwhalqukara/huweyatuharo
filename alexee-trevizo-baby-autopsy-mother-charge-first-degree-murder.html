Even at the age of 19, she is still a youthful woman.&nbsp;</p><p>The charges of first-degree murder were brought against her a week ago. Alternately, she molested a child, which ultimately led to the youngster’s death. There is a wide range of evidence that points against her.&nbsp;</p><p>A young woman from New Mexico admitted to giving birth in a hospital bathroom. And then hiding the baby in a garbage can, where it was found dead a short time later. according to footage from a police body camera that was previously made public.&nbsp;</p><p>Alexee Trevizo, 19, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, or assaulting a child that resulted in death.</p><p>And tampering with evidence just a week after she gave clandestine birth to her baby at Artesia General Hospital on January 27. According to the charges, Trevizo also tampered with evidence. Just scroll down to see what she had to say about it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is the Alexee Trevizo mother of baby?</h2><p>As for her apology, she admitted as much. Trevizo told her mother and the doctor that the child’s body had been found in the bathroom and that “it came out of her, and she didn’t know what to do.”She broke the news to Lexee.&nbsp;</p><p>All she wanted was for Lexee Baby to tell the truth to her. Her sobbing mother finally responded.&nbsp;</p><p>Before assuring the nurse that “it was not crying or anything,” Trevizo said, “She was scared.” Her mother got enraged, yelling, “What did you do to it?”she was going to help the cops, but medics silenced her so she wouldn’t.</p><p>Trevizo had back problems and had gone to the hospital that morning; they were located about 80 miles from the Texas border in New Mexico.&nbsp;</p><p>A doctor can be seen telling investigators that Trevizo denied having intercourse despite testing suggesting she was pregnant.&nbsp;</p><p>She supposedly locked herself in a hospital lavatory for “quite a while,” when doctors finally convinced her to unlock the door, they found her mopping up a lot of blood off the floor.</p><p>Until one of the nurses discovered the dead, full-term baby in the trash, the physicians assumed she had “done something to herself” to terminate the pregnancy.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the doctor, she threw the infant in the trash and covered it with a fresh liner.

Nothing was sobbing,” she continued. It yielded no results. The infant’s death was confirmed by a hospital staff member present: “The baby’s dead. She had the child murdered. The question “What did you do?” was repeated frantically by Trevizo’s mother.</p><p>The Office of the Medical Investigator of New Mexico concluded that the death of the newborn was a homicide since the air was found in the infant’s lungs during the autopsy, ruling out the possibility of a stillbirth.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCty56vnp1dqb%2BmwsizpmaakZfGbq3Uraapq6lk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alexandra-daddario-height-age-boyfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Alexandra Daddario Height, Age, Boyfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</span></a>
