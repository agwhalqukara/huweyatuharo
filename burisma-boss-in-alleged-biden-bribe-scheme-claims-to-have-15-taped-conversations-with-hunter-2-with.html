These recordings were allegedly kept as a sort of insurance policy for the foreign national in case he got into a tight spot. The 1023 also indicates that then-Vice President Joe Biden may have been involved in Burisma employing Hunter Biden.”</p><p>The senator concluded: “So, as I’ve repeatedly asked since going public with the existence of the 1023, what, if anything, has the Justice Department and FBI done to investigate? The Justice Department and FBI must show their work. They no longer deserve the benefit of the doubt.”</p><p>It’s unclear if the FBI has possession of any of the purported tapes.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“Congress still lacks a full and complete picture with respect to what that document really says.
