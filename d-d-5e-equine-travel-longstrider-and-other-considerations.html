How would this improve travel times?<ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>+10' to a creature with a 60' move is only an 16.67% increase in speed, which would convert 8 miles into 9.33 miles during an hour spent galloping (if I did my math correctly). Not amazing, unless that extra 1.33 miles covered during the hour is somehow a matter of life and death. It would be fun if this spell could somehow grant a better benefit to overland travel. casting it on a creature with 30' of base movement grants a 33.33% increase which is nicer, but would only up a fast movement speed of 4 miles / hour to 5.33 miles / hour. Again, not super impressive.</li></ul></li><li data-xf-list-type=ol><b>Galloping in darkness </b>- what kind of light source is needed to provide enough light for horse and rider with adequate visibility<ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>According to online sources I found, headlight beams are recommended to be aimed at the ground 100' in front of the car. While this wouldn't be the extreme limit of visibility it at least gives a starting target. Vehicles traveling at legal freeway speeds range between 65 and 80 mph in the U.S. The average horse maxes out at 30 mph (according to unverifiable internet sources). I'm not sure the reaction time required for speed traveling is a linear progression, but seems like a lantern ( 30 ft. bright / 30 ft. dim) held aloft by a rider could get the job done in a pinch and a daylight spell ( 60 ft. bright / 60 ft. dim) or an everbright lantern ( cone 60 ft. bright / 60 ft. dim ) would be more than adequate.</li></ul></li>Also to note, according to internet sources, the pony express averaged 8 - 10 miles per hour, with horses not galloping but a combination of canters, gallops, and trots. Most horses can only gallop at top speeds from 1 to 2 miles before tiring out completely... so where the PHB allows for 1 hour travel at a gallop would more realistically be described as trotting at an advanced pace. 30 mph top speeds would allow for 30 miles of travel in single hour if such a rate could be sustained, and this obviously isn't the case.<p>With some decent luck, someone could get another 8 miles out of a 2nd hour of "galloping" travel - would have to pass con saves of 12, 14, 16, and 18 for their mount - add in some magic buffs and who knows what could happen!</p><p>Would love to hear others ideas, opinions, clarifications, thoughts, etc. on the matter!</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prrWqKmlnF6kv6h706GpnpmUqHymvdSipZ5lpKeut7HLZqOoppeowbO1w56pZpmemXqwwMeeqWabn6PAqrDEq5itoZ%2BjwG%2BCl2prbnFf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cindy-pickett-net-worth-2024-career-earnings-and-real-estate.html><span>←</span><span>Cindy Pickett Net Worth 2024: Career, Earnings, and Real Estate</span></a>
