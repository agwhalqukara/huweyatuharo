It was enough for me.”</p><p class=p1>Shortly after news of her split broke, it was also announced that she would not be returning for season 17 of the Bravo series. However, she has no regrets about putting her personal life on camera and feels the outcome of her marriage would have been the same had she not done the show.</p><p class=p1>“I don’t know exactly what’s happening with Ryne, like a week to week, month to month, day to day thing,&nbsp;don’t know,” Jen told <i>Us.</i>“But I don’t feel like the show caused anything, it magnifies what’s already going on. It just puts you in a more intense situation. So no, I wouldn’t blame the show for that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>While the cosmetic dermatologist is grateful for her experience on the show, she did wish she got another chance to share her story on the Bravo series since she alleges she was “heavily edited” during season 16.</p><p class=p1>“I don’t regret doing the show, but I wish I had a better support system throughout the show,” she explained to Us. “I feel like the first year you don’t really know what you’re getting into and so if you get a second season, you get your legs and you kind of know how it works, this is what I need, going into the next one. I feel like the next one would be way better just because you’ve experienced, you’ve got like the rookie season done. So, that would be nice and it would be great to have that opportunity.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmqaeUmK60wNJonp6spJ67qHnRnpilZaeewal506GcZqCfqsCmw8ivnKxnlKd6q7HNZpirpaOpv7C6xmagZpyfo8FursuapJ5lop28pHnFqKlmqqmjsm60zqWjopyRrnq0vMuiq2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./d-d-5e-equine-travel-longstrider-and-other-considerations.html><span>←</span><span>D&amp;amp;D 5E - Equine travel, Longstrider, and other considerations</span></a>
