<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Fellow defendant handed Young Thug painkiller in court, prosecutors say</h1></header><section class=post-content><p class=story-text data-index=6>“Defendant Adams, who is currently serving a life-without-parole sentence for murder, conducted a hand-to-hand drug transaction with Defendant Jeffery Lamar Williams, in open court,” the state’s motion said. “As a result of Defendant Williams’ and Defendant Adams’ possession and distribution, respectively, of contraband, court was delayed and adjourned before a single juror hardship was addressed for the day,” according to the state’s motion, which argues that the actions delayed jury selection.</p><p class=story-text data-index=7>Attorney Teombre Calland, who represents Adams, dismissed the claims.</p><p class=story-text data-index=8>“Mr. Adams adamantly maintains his innocence and looks forward to the conclusion of this trial,” she said.</p><p class=story-text data-index=10>Attorney Keith Adams, who represents Williams, said the motion “is replete with factual inaccuracies, embellishments and attempts to make Mr. Williams responsible for someone else’s actions. The end result of an investigation into (Wednesday’s) incident was that Mr. Williams was not engaged in any wrongdoing.”</p><p class=story-text data-index=12>Williams is accused of being the leader of Young Slime Life, an alleged criminal street gang based in southwest Atlanta. He is set to stand trial along with 13 other alleged associates. The defense maintains YSL is just a record label, not a gang.</p><p class=story-text data-index=13>Suri Chadha Jimenez, who represents co-defendant Cordarius Dorsey, said in a motion the DA’s office “deliberately published” its version of events knowing media coverage would follow.</p><p class=story-text data-index=14>Courthouse visitors must go through security checkpoints, empty their pockets and remove jackets and bags. Deputies then usher them through a metal detector while their belongings are run through an X-ray machine.</p><p class=story-text data-index=15>There have been multiple contraband instances at the Fulton County jail. In June, a 45-year-old maintenance worker was arrested after jail officials accused him of bringing <a href=#>marijuana, cigarettes and a cellphone</a> to detainees.</p><p class=story-text data-index=16>A month earlier, a 24-year-old medical worker attempted to bring in drugs and tobacco products. The woman <a href=#>panicked during questioning and bolted</a>, leaving behind 192 grams of pot, 20 grams of suspected crack cocaine and tobacco, officials said. She was arrested weeks later in Mississippi.</p><p class=story-text data-index=19>Another contracted medical assistant was arrested at the jail earlier this month after deputies <a href=#>found marijuana and tobacco inside her food containers</a>, authorities said.</p><p class=story-text data-index=20>Chief Judge Ural Glanville placed court in recess shortly after Wednesday’s incident, the <a href=#>third incident involving contraband brought into the courthouse</a> in recent days.</p><p class=story-text data-index=21>“The reason for the delay is that we’ve had yet another instance of alleged contraband being introduced to our space. As a result of that and a subsequent investigation, one of our inmates unfortunately had to go to Grady hospital,” Glanville said, referring to Kahlieff Adams.</p><p class=story-text data-index=22>Deputies approached Williams after the alleged handoff. According to the state’s motion, Williams gave deputies the Percocet.</p><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Natrice Miller / Natrice.Miller@ajc.com</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/news/crime/fellow-defendant-handed-young-thug-painkiller-in-court-da-alleges/ICTHFPHYIND73ED2FADYTETHME/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Natrice Miller / Natrice.Miller@ajc.com</p><p class=story-text data-index=25>Deputies then searched Kahlieff Adams, who initially resisted, and found Percocet, marijuana, tobacco and other contraband wrapped in plastic and food seasonings to hide the odor, the state said.</p><p class=story-text data-index=26>“Deputies quickly apprehended the detainee and took possession of the contraband, and completed a search to ensure no more contraband was present,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement.</p><p class=story-text data-index=27>Kahlieff Adams was taken to the hospital after he appeared to have ingested items in what the state said was to conceal further crimes.</p><p class=story-text data-index=28>Jimenez said Kahlieff Adams was taken to a holding area following the encounter. Defense attorneys saw “at least two officers remove their belts and firearms” before going into the holding area, he said, then heard “several minutes” of loud noises coming from the back.</p><p class=story-text data-index=29>He asserts that deputies used a Taser on Kahlieff Adams before taking him to the hospital.</p><p class=story-text data-index=31>“Mr. Adams was also transported because he needed medical assistance after being tased several times by officers,” Jimenez wrote, raising concerns that some potential jurors heard the commotion.</p><p class=story-text data-index=32>He asked that the GBI investigate whether a crime took place in the courtroom and whether excessive forced was used by deputies.</p><p class=story-text data-index=33>Kahlieff Adams, who is serving a life sentence at Hays State Prison for a 2019 murder conviction, was back in court Thursday morning. He is charged with conspiracy to violate the state’s RICO Act and attempted murder in the sprawling gang case. He is now also charged with possession of schedule II controlled substances, two counts of willful obstruction of law enforcement officers, possession of marijuana less than an ounce and possession of an alcoholic beverage by an inmate.</p><p class=story-text data-index=34>Co-defendants Rodalius Ryan and Damone Blalock were also charged in Wednesday’s incident. Ryan was charged with unauthorized possession of a prohibited item by an inmate, and Blalock was charged with giving an inmate a prohibited item without authorization.</p><p class=story-text data-index=35>Williams was not charged in the incident.</p><p class=story-text data-index=37>“The responsible parties were charged and appeared in court for first appearances (Thursday) morning,” said attorney Keith Adams, who is not related to defendant Kahlieff Adams.</p><p class=story-text data-index=38>All three had their first appearance hearings and were denied bond on their new charges.</p><p class=story-text data-index=39>More than 600 potential jurors were summoned to court at the beginning of the year. Weeks later, prosecutors and defense attorneys are still working through hardships and haven’t seated a single person. Most of those who have asked to be excused say they can’t afford to miss work to serve on a jury for six to nine months, which is how long the trial is expected to last.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orbCZ5qopV%2Bjsri%2FjpypoqWVZLOmuMuormaclZuyr7DAp6tmoJGjsaawjLKmrqaXYsGpwcZmp5qhnqC2rbjEq2Sipl2YvLa%2B02abmmWRobmms8SsZoJ7hH2TkZS4goV9b2N6kXOSoH2QjX2EfZqGew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brand-of-french-mineral-water.html><span>←</span><span>Brand of French mineral water</span></a>
