He then used the wood glue to glue the top and bottom round panels onto the dome.</p><p>“After that, he measured and cut the dowels with a hand saw and once we glued the dowels on together, working side-by-side, he sanded the entire table.”</p><p><b>RELATED: <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=035d61121f32fe29d3643304addbc638 data-tgev-label=lifestyle data-tgev-metric=ev>$20 Bunnings fix to stop nosy neighbours</a></b></p><p>Chantelle then completed the look by applying three coats of the Monocel Clear Timber Varnish also from <a class=body-link href=# rel=nofollow title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=bunnings data-tgev-label=topics data-tgev-metric=ev>Bunnings</a>.</p><p>Chantelle said she has always been inspired by home decor and with Zach’s skill working on high-end projects, they tried their luck not realising how good it would turn out.</p><p>“I was so happy with it even before we applied the varnish. I just kept telling Zach ‘I am so in love with it’ and it’s now sitting exactly where I wanted it to in the living room.”</p><p>“I know if we bought the one for $3,500 I probably wouldn’t have felt as good because of the price. But it definitely feels way better when you know you’ve made it yourself.”</p><p>The 22-year-old, who works in sales for a contractor management company, said Zach was also super proud, telling all his tradie mates all about it at work, particularly after the massive reaction it got on <a class=body-link href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><p>Chantell shared a time lapse video of DIY project on the social media platform on Thursday and it has already clocked 1.8 million views.</p><p>“Looks better than the expensive one actually,” one user commented.</p><p>“OK I would buy your version,” another person added, while a third said: “This is some talent right there!! Amazing work!!”</p><p>Chantelle said she was “so shocked” by the positive response, saying she “freaked out” when it hit 100,000 views that night, let alone over a million the following day.</p><p>“I can’t believe a home job DIY coffee table has blown up... who would have thought.”</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Bunnings data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Bunnings</a><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Kmart data-tgev-order=2 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Kmart</a><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=TikTok data-tgev-order=3 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>TikTok</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme8eopJ5nlJ7GcLPOpZtmm5%2BWwLV5wqisqaSVYrSwedWiqZqkXaTDpr6MnaCyZZKqu6%2B1zaCqZqOdlr%2B1ecKonZ%2BdlWLBoq7LnmannaeoerTAzquwaGtjaoBzsZibaGmdlpixcX2WmppummJlfnWvlJyZb5th</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amare-stoudemire-net-worth-2024-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Amare Stoudemire Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
