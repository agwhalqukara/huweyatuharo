あれからすでに２年の歳月が流れようとしてます。
元々馴れ初めは２０１１年で、
３年半の交際を経ての結婚でしたが、
互いに子持ちだっという背景から、
結婚当初は難しい意見が多くありました。
実際に２年の月日を迎えて、
吉井和哉さんと眞鍋さんの結婚生活は、
どれだけ順調なのか？
週刊誌などでは、
比較的にネガティブな記事もありますが、
本当のところはどのような感じなのか・・・。
吉井和哉と真鍋かをりは離婚する？
互いに再婚を果たして僅かな時間しか流れてませんが、
某週刊誌などでは、雲行きがあやしいという内容の記事が出てます。
忙しく全国を駆け巡る吉井和哉さんのことを考えると、
ファンにとっては面白い内容ではないですね・・・。
12月15日発売の「女性自身」（光文社）では、怪しい雲行きを伝えている。同誌記事によると、眞鍋にとって初めての子供がまだ生後2カ月であるにも関わらず、吉井は育児のサポートを一切行わないという。「吉井が育児をなにもサポートしてくれないため、眞鍋が『もう離婚しちゃおうかな』と周囲に愚痴っている」という内容の芸能関係者のコメントもあり、穏やかではない。
同誌は都内の高級スーパーでひとり買い物を終えた眞鍋を直撃取材。眞鍋は記者の出産を祝う言葉に「ありがとうございます」と笑顔で応答し、「吉井さんとの夫婦関係はどうですか？」との質問には「取材は直接お答えすることはできないんです」とにこやかなままで答えたという。笑顔の裏にある真意は？眞鍋の所属事務所は、別居や不仲について「離婚は絶対にありません」と宣言している。引用元：http://www.excite.co.jp/News/entertainment_g/20151215/Messy_5562.html?_p=2

これはあくま憶測でしかなく、
実際は、ライブツアーに忙しく、
なかなか心の余裕が作れないのかな？と。
眞鍋さん側は不仲や別居の噂に関しては、
離婚することはないと言及してますが、
やはり本人たちの口からはっきり聞いてみたいですね。
１４歳の年の差が単純に難しかったのか？など、
難しい事情は置いておいて、素朴な問題である可能性だってありますからね。
しかし、不思議なぐらいに、
吉井和哉さんと眞鍋さんが揃った写真がないのが、
ちょっと違和感あるなとは、思います。
吉井和哉と真鍋かをりの目撃と世田谷に新居の噂(フライデーではない) 吉井和哉さんが自宅に帰る姿が、
なかなか目撃されないということで、
別居してるか、吉井さんが一方的に出て行ったか・・・。
この部分に関しては、まだまだ確信ある報道はないですが、
ラブラブなツーショットがないのは寂しいですね！
子供が大きくなった時に、
３人で手を繋いでる和やかな光景があればなと！
だが、結婚の意思を公表したものの、すぐに入籍とはいかなかった。入籍はなぜか9月。8月には早くも二人の間に不協和音が鳴り響いているとの説が出始めていた。6月以降、二人が住むマンション周辺では、吉井の姿が見かけられなくなったという。身重の妻のサポートをすることなく、吉井がひとりで家を出て行ったとも報道されたが……これに対してはちょうど全国各地で開催される夏の音楽フェスに出演するためではないかと楽観視する向きもあった引用元：http://www.excite.co.jp/News/entertainment_g/20151215/Messy_5562.html
そもそも吉井和哉さんは暇な方ではないので、
単純に音楽に集中するために、色々と工夫をされているだけかも？
今年２０１７年も、イエモンは大きなライブツアーを控えてます。
リハーサル、演出の確認から、
吉井和哉さんの作業量は膨大なはずです。
普通のお父さんのように、
毎日、家に帰って家族サービスするのは、
なかなか難しいように感じます。
イエモンのライブが終わった後も、色々と忙しそう・・・・、
元ファンである眞鍋さんであれば、それを理解して支えることはできると信じましょう！
今年の１１月１１日には、
イエモンのドキュメント映画、
「オトトキ」が公開されるので、
そこで吉井和哉さんの私生活の一部は見れそうです。
きっと、忙しくて、忙しくて・・・な吉井和哉さんの姿が映ってるはずです！
結婚とイエモンの再結成、新曲、ツアーが重なるのは、
ちょっと時期的には難しかったのかなと思います。
ちなみにネット上で世田谷に新居を購入したような噂がありますが、
これが本当なら、まだまだ夫婦仲良しってことですかね？？
新居の話は週刊誌でなく、ただのネット上での話なので何も信憑性がないですが。
