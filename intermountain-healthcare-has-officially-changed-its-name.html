The name change is effective immediately, but the updated look will gradually be phased in over the next several years.</p><p>Some of the more noticeable early changes will occur on Intermountain Health’s websites and with digital tools available to patients and the community.</p><p>Intermountain Health operates multiple medical facilities in Idaho and in six other western states. Intermountain Health is a nonprofit system of 33 hospitals, 385 clinics, medical groups with some 3,900 employed physicians and advanced care providers, a health plans division called SelectHealthwith more than one million members, and other health services.
