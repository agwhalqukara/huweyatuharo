I did NOT see this one coming. Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony have announced, through a joint statement, that they are “ending their marriage”. This is not a touchy-feely announcement of “separation, but we’re trying to work something out.” This is flat-out “We’re getting a divorce, y’all.” You know what was the signal? Jennifer <a href=#>took her mother</a> to last weekend’s BAFTA event, not Marc. Everybody was like “Oh, her mom probably wanted to meet Waity.” But no, that was the signal.</p><p>Jennifer Lopez and husband Marc Anthony have called it quits.</p><p>The couple just released a statement, claiming, “We have decided to end our marriage. This was a very difficult decision. We have come to an amicable conclusion on all matters.”</p><p>The story was first reported on People.com.</p><p>This will be Jennifer’s THIRD divorce — she was first married in 1997 to Ojani Noa, and again in 2001 to her backup dancer Cris Judd. This will be Marc’s second divorce.</p><p>The couple got married in 2004 in their Beverly Hills home. They have two children.</p><p>Marc and JLo renewed their vows just last year on their 6th anniversary — and back in May, they gave a steamy performance together on the season finale of “American Idol.”</p><p>[<a href=#>From TMZ</a>]</p><p>Is this depressing to anyone else? I mean, yes, Jennifer is kind of crazy and she’s kind of a diva, but I thought Marc really loved her and that she adored him right back. You know what will be interesting? It will be interesting to hear if one of them was screwing around, first of all, and second of all, it will be interesting to see how the money stuff plays out. You know Marc has <a href=#>big tax problems</a>, right? Oh, it’s going to get good.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wenn3362536.jpg alt=wenn3362536 title=wenn3362536 width=570 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wenn5660091.jpg alt=wenn5660091 title=wenn5660091 width=570 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmam5pZYB1e8mepaehlpq%2FoLjOqZyzl5GjsaC5wKuamJmeqbWwutiYn5qulZSxpq%2FInZydl6SkrKa6w5iroZ2Zp6yurdGroJqflWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eat-your-way-to-healthy-hair-with-top-tips-from-raymond-blanc-s-fianc%C3%A9e.html><span>←</span><span>Eat your way to healthy hair with top tips from Raymond Blanc's fiance</span></a>
