As you can imagine, a lot of social media users were not happy to hear this, expressing their outrage on their platforms.</p><p>It all started with Kim sharing <a href=#>the rapper</a>’s tweet about him running for the highest office, the celeb adding an emoji of the American flag to the initial announcement.</p><p>Now, she is dealing with backlash, for even considering supporting him.</p><p>Here are a couple of the reactions to her post: ‘Democracy is not a plaything for the rich and famous. Real lives are at stake.’ / ‘They don’t care. This is all a fame game for them, the consequences of which they will not suffer.’</p><p>Of course, the response was not completely negative as there were enough users supporting them.</p><p>One fan, for instance, tweeted a pic of Kim and daughter North cuddling during a visit at the Oval Office and joked that if Kanye were to be elected, it would really be the ‘WEST wing!’</p><p>At the same time, there were plenty of people who argued that the sole reason Ye is doing this is to help Donald Trump get re-elected this fall.</p><p>Actor Eric Balfour reacted as well, posting: ‘Do you guys think this is all a joke? That potentially pulling votes away from the only nominee who can defeat Donald Trump is cute or funny? This is the height of privilege, ultimately it won’t hurt you, you’re wealthy enough to survive 4 more years of Trump! Come the f**k on!’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The original tweet from Kanye reads: ‘We must realize the promise of America by trusting God now, unifying our vision and building the future. I’m running for president of the United States! #2020VISION.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebqsS1t4ykoKZlm5a%2Fpa3SoaCapl2eu260zq1ksJmkmr9urcWtnKtlo528uLXNoGSsraClvLPAjK2mZqORo8amedaeqq2rXaW5orrSZquoZaKqu26yzqtkqaqVqLalsc2tZG1pY2d%2BeXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-fagan-spouse-partner-wife-relationship-married-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Fagan Spouse, Partner, Wife, Relationship, Married &amp;amp; Net Worth</span></a>
