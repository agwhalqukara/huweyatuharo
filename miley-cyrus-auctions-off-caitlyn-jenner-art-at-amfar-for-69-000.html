<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Miley Cyrus Auctions Off Caitlyn Jenner Art at amfAR for $69,000</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It was a party in New York City for <strong>Miley Cyrus</strong> on Tuesday, June 16. The "Wrecking Ball" singer, 22, was honored at amfAR's sixth Inspiration Gala, where she also raised thousands of dollars for charity with the sale of her original artwork of none other than<strong> <a href=#>Caitlyn Jenner</a></strong>.</p><p>Cyrus was the guest of honor alongside <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> at the annual event, held at Manhattan's Spring Street Studios and produced by <strong>Josh Wood</strong>. The former child star made a speech at the star-studded soirée and contributed three pieces of art to the live auction.&nbsp;</p><p>Last week, after Jenner's <a href=#>talked-about Vanity Fair cover</a> made its debut, <a href=#>Cyrus Instagrammed photos</a> of a reimagined cover that she spent time decorating with paint, glitter, sequins, and other embellishments. The Hannah Montana alum made three covers in total, and auctioned them off as a package at amfAR.</p><p>In a moment that thrilled the boundary-pushing star, the three pieces sold for a total of $69,000. Cyrus' charitable sales, which will benefit amfAR's mission of supporting AIDS research and HIV education, went down nine months after she made her debut as an artist during New York Fashion Week with her <a href=#>Dirty Hippie Art Show</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Cyrus continued the Dirty Hippie theme with her latest creations, also tying the art to her new <a href=#>Happy Hippie Foundation</a>, which is working with Instagram to support the LGBTQ community.&nbsp;</p><p>That same evening, Cyrus took the stage at the gala to accept the Inspiration Award and made an emotional speech in which she touched on homeless youth, HIV and AIDS, and even amfAR co-founder <strong>Elizabeth Taylor</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>"Getting the Inspiration Award tonight is an honor that is unbelievable," she told the crowd. "Seriously, I didn't believe them when they told me that I got it because it seems just way to easy and it seems as if there is no way that I have done nearly enough to be standing here on the receiving end of this honor. But, I am thinking as not celebrating what me and Happy Hippie have already done, but celebrating what we are going to do, what we plan on doing in the future. And tonight is not a finish line for us, but it is a starting point and I want to work every day to do something good for somebody else so that I feel not only as if this honor [hasn't] been wasted, but my life and all of the influence that comes with it."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKSipJWueqTF0a6qZpmlmMGqu82sZKielmKworXTpbCnZZqau6%2Bx0WaYq6xdlsFurcyfmKtllqS%2FboKYaWdpZWJlfnZ9lm8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-middleton-wows-crowds-with-her-incredibly-toned-arms-here-s-how-she-works-them.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Middleton wows crowds with her incredibly toned arms here's how she works them</span></a>
