In true Rihanna style, the video, which also stars featured artist Drake, is a right steamy affair and includes plenty of grinding and outfits that leave very little to the imagination.
In fact, Rihanna has treated us to TWO videos back to back. The first half, directed by Director X, is set in a dimly lit party, where Rihanna puts on all the moves."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The first half, directed by Director X, is set in a dimly lit party, where Rihanna puts on all the moves. As the party draws to a close, a loading bar appears, before unveiling a second video directed by Tim Erem. This time, Rihanna and Drake&nbsp;put on a private show&nbsp;alone in a pink room, however, the&nbsp;video is very much the same in terms of the dancing (aside from Drake busting some of his ‘Hotline Bling’ moves!)</p><p>‘Work’ is the first single from Rihanna’s latest album, Anti. This is the third time that the pair have worked together musically, following ‘What’s My Name?’ and ‘Take Care’.</p><p>The video will be a welcome distraction for many of Rihanna’s fans, after the singer rescheduled and cancelled some of her tour dates due to <a href=#>‘logistical reasons beyond the tour’s control’</a>. She is also&nbsp;due to perform at The Brit Awards in London on Wednesday, however, after cancelling her Grammy Awards performance last week due to bronchitis, we will have to wait and see if she will be well enough to perform.</p><p>For the time being, you can watch the raunchy video for ‘Work’ below.</p><p></p><p>What do you make of the ‘Work’ video?
