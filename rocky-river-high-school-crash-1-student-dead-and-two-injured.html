It is with a heavy heart that I inform you that one of our students died, and the other two suffered serious injuries. We are heartbroken by this loss of life, and we grieve with the family and friends of our students. Our thoughts are prayers with the families and friends of all three students.</p><p>Sudden death and life-threatening injuries can be difficult for us to understand, especially with young people. We may feel various emotions: shock, sadness, or confusion. What is most important is that we care for and support each other. The Crisis Response Team has made plans to respond to the emotional needs of all students. Counselors will be highly visible throughout the building and available to assist with grief counseling.</p><p>If your family has experienced a death or similar loss recently, this accident may bring up strong feelings. While this may be a normal experience, we want to provide assistance if needed. Please inform your student’s teacher or our counselors if there is any additional information the school should know so we can support your student’s needs.</p><p>This difficult time can be stressful and confusing. A sudden death may be disturbing to you as well as to your student. For this reason, we especially want you to know of our care and support. Thank you for your continued support of&nbsp;Rocky River High School.”</p><p>No further details have been released on social media, and students’ identities have remained unknown.
