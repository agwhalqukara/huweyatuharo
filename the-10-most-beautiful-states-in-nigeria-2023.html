The state also prides itself on its beauty that is found in nature, modern infrastructures, and historical landmarks that include one of the oldest markets in Nigeria, Kurmi Market, which was founded in 1463.</p><p>Kano State also boasts of being an economic hub of Nigeria as it generates more than $12 billion yearly. This makes the state one of the richest.

However, the state is famous for having a vast number of beautiful hotels. The music, culture, and food in the glint of night lights set Imo as a stable of beauty at day and at night. The state which has Igbo as its major language flourishes in terms of its economy as well as being home to numerous institutions.</p><h4><strong>Beautiful Places in Imo State</strong></h4><ul><li>Oguta Lake</li><li>Owerri Zoo</li><li>Orashi River</li><li>Imo Palm Plantation Complex</li><li>The Freedom Square Owerri</li><li>Nekede Zoo</li><li>Art Centre</li><li>Mnari Cultural Centre</li></ul><h3><strong>8.

It houses recreational centers, beaches, museums, road networks, and other standard infrastructures. Even with the adoption of these modern things that increase the beauty of Akwa Ibom, the state has not forgotten to carry on with its traditions that help in harboring a number of ancient architectural buildings. Akwa Ibom’s beauty can also be found in nature as it has swamps and wetlands, oil palms, tropical rain forests, and its economic and aesthetic coastline.</p><h4><strong>Some Beautiful Places in Akwa Ibom</strong></h4><ul><li>National Museum Colonial History</li><li>The Amalgamation House</li><li>Ibeno Beach</li><li>Unity Park</li><li>The 30,000 seater Akwa Ibom International Stadium</li><li>Bridge of no Return</li><li>Discovery Park</li></ul><h3><strong>7.

Its rich blend of nature and modern infrastructure places it as a wonderful place to be in Nigeria. It serves as home to many tourist sites, investment opportunities, and the famous Obudu Mountain Resort. It also harbors some important historical markings in Nigeria.</p><p>In addition, the 4-Km cable car network allows for an unhindered view across the highlands for over 5200 feet above sea level. Cross River can be said to have it all from the forest walkway, waterfalls, and hospitable environment. Apart from its physical beauty, the state is famous for its rich cultural heritage, especially the annual Calabar Festival which sees the attendance of many people from different parts of Nigeria and beyond.</p><h4><strong>Some Beautiful and Unique Places in Cross Rivers</strong></h4><ul><li>Mary Slessor’s House</li><li>Chief Ekpo Bassey’s House (was imported and assembled)</li><li>The oldest school in eastern Nigeria (Hope Wadell Training Institution.

Its beauty goes beyond the physical as it has one of the coldest climates in Nigeria. The weather provides a conducive environment for vegetative growths which paints the state with masses of evergreen farmlands and grasslands in different parts of the state, producing some major foods that can rarely be produced anywhere else in Nigeria. These foods include irish potatoes, tomato (popular as “tomato Jos”), cabbage, and broccoli among others. It is also the home for an endemic bird, the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Jos Plateau Indigobird</a> (Vidua Maryae) and Rock Fire Finch which are found only in the state and nowhere else in the world.</p><p>Many of the beautiful assets of Plateau State is a result of nature which leads to its harboring one of the highest hills in Nigeria – Shere Hills. It also has more mountains, hills, and valleys than probably any other State in Nigeria. Little wonder it was named Plateau to mean an area of fairly level high ground. Another unique natural beauty is found in its ability to rain ice during the rainy season and cover by a haze many times of the year.</p><p>The state is known for its rich columbite ores, exotic fruits and vegetables and well-designed road network which allows for further admiration. However, coming down to man-made beauty, it is home to one of the oldest universities in Nigeria, the University of Jos.</p><h4><strong>Some Beautiful Places in Plateau State</strong></h4><ul><li>Jos Wildlife Park</li><li>Jos Golf Course</li><li>The 10 Commandments monument</li><li>Solomon Lar Amusement Park</li></ul><h3><strong>5.

Rather than just being a state that increases the wealth of Nigeria, it also boasts of being one of the most beautiful states in the nation.</p><p>Its beauty can be found in its abundance of tourist sites and rich cultural history that gives a taste of present-day wonder and ancient imagination to visitors. There are open forests, aqua formations, high mountains, and valley groves. Akpugoeze monkeys are found only in this part of the world and constitute a high-profile species.</p><p>The state also sits as one of the most important states in the history of the Igbo people, especially because it served as the capital of the Republic of Biafra in 1967. In the present day, Enugu is the 7th most populated State in Nigeria.</p><h4><strong>Some of the Most Awesome Places in Enugu</strong></h4><ul><li>Nnamdi Azikiwe International Stadium</li><li>Ngwo Pine Forest</li><li>Awhum Waterfall and Caves</li><li>Nike Lake</li><li>Michael Okpara Square</li><li>Milken Hill</li><li>Ebeano Tunnel</li></ul><h3><strong>4.

It is one of the popular states of Nigeria and it is known for being a major oil-producing state counting its GDP in several billions of dollars.

Whatever the reason for the trip, the ultramodern settings composed of skyscrapers and architectural marvels create a resonating air of big city vibes all day and all night.</p><p>Some of the most beautiful places can be found in places such as Ikeja and Victoria Island. To cater to the many visitors and inhabitants, Lagos houses some of the best hotels in the country. Transcorp Hilton, Sheraton, and Eko Hotel among others. It is also home to some of Nigeria’s biggest clubs as well as has a standing place at the top of the list of cities of entertainment in Africa.</p><h4><strong>Most Beautiful Places in Lagos</strong></h4><ul><li>Beaches (Eloko, Kuramo, Oniru, Elegushi, and Atican beaches)</li><li>Freedom Park</li><li>La Campagne Tropicana</li><li>Tarkwa Bay</li><li>Lakowa Lakes Golf and Country Estate</li><li>Epe Resort and Spa</li><li>Bogobiri House</li></ul><h3><strong>1.

It is one of the fastest-growing cities in Nigeria and is mostly defined by its road network, internet connectivity, urban development planning, companies and organizations, historical buildings, nature reserves, and landmarks.</p><p>An additional attraction in Abuja is the attention to detail in the construction of its places of worship.
