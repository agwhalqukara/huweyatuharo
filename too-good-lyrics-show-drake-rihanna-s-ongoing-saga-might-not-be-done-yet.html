After all, they've been rumored to be "<a href=# class=T3D>on again/off again" since 2009</a>, and music fans are on both sides of the argument when it comes to <a href=# class=T3D>Drake and Rihanna as a couple</a>. Some fans, myself included, are obsessed with the idea of <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Drake and his "ultimate fantasy"</a> someday making it official... while others simply aren't shipping them at all. Each argument has valid points, but <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Drake and Rihanna's newest collaboration</a> on <i>Views </i>proves how damn <i>good </i>it is when they collaborate. In fact, when the pair comes together musically, it's seriously "too good."</p><p>Their song "Too Good" itself seems to be about a longtime couple in despair, based on the lyrics, with Drake crooning, "My friends always feel the need to tell me things / Seems like they're just happier than us these days," which actually makes my heart ache a little bit. Though the couple in the song seem to have a plethora of issues to work through, there are definitely hints that there's more there than meets the eye... or ear, as it may be. Check out the lyrics for yourself and see how this could, just maybe, relate to Drake and Rihanna's own relationship.</p><p><i>Drake: I don't know how to talk to you / I don't know how to ask you if you're OK / My friends always feel the need to tell me things / Seems like they're just happier than us these days</i></p><p>Well, this doesn't sound positive. It sounds like the realization that there's a disconnect in the relationship, for sure. This is definitely reminiscent of when <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Drake told <i>The New York Times</i></a> in 2010 of Rihanna, "You know what she was doing to me? She was doing exactly what I’ve done to so many women throughout my life, which is show them quality time, then disappear. I was like, wow, this feels terrible." Ouch.</p><p><i>Drake: I don't know how to be there when you need me / It feels like the only time you see me / Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently</i></p><p>In 2010, Drake reflected on his relationship, telling <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Ellen DeGeneres that he and Rih</a> "had our moment." -sad face emoji-</p><p><i>Drake: I'm too good for you / I'm way too good to you / You take my love for granted / I just don't understand it</i></p><p>I don't understand it either, Drizzy! <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>You told <i>Rolling Stone</i></a> she was your "dog for life" and "ultimate fantasy."</p><p><i>Rihanna: I don't know how to talk to you / I just know I found myself getting lost with you / Lately you just make me work too hard for you / Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you</i></p><p>Is this true, Drake? Not cool. For her part, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Rih reportedly told <i>Cosmopolitan</i> </a>in 2011, "I'm open to love. But guys should have to earn it. Because the minute they get it, they want something else." Although it's not confirmed if she was talking about Drake, there are totally parallels here.</p><p><i>Drake: Years go by too fast / I can't keep track / How long did we last? / I feel bad for asking / It can't end like this / We gotta take time with this</i></p><p>Yes, please. Take your time, guys! Given that the two have been on and off for seven years, it's not surprising if they feel like they've gotta take their time.</p><p><i>Drake: And I wanna tell you my intentions / I wanna do the things that I mention / I wanna benefit from the friendship / I wanna get the late night message from you, from you / I put my hands around you / Gotta get a handle on you</i></p><p>It certainly seems like he's not ready to throw in the towel just yet on this love. The two continue to work together, and he sung her praises discussing <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>her work on "Too Good"</a> with Beats 1 Radio by saying, "She got in the studio and just bodied it. It was flawless victory when she sent it back. Everything was perfect... We have a genuine energy between us." I'd say it definitely seems like there's plenty of love between them, despite this song's sad message.</p><p>So while neither Drake nor Rihanna have confirmed rumors of a romance, or even that this song is in any way reflective of their real-life relationship, it definitely seems like there's some seriously deep feelings there. The saga of Rih and Drake doesn't seem to be <i>quite </i>over just yet, and depending on your feelings toward them, that's either a good thing or a bad thing. Either way, their collaboration on <i>Views </i>is fire.</p><p><i>Images: <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Giphy</a> (3)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxygZZxanJlpKS8brPOqJtmpKmntqS%2FjKyfqK9dmb%2Bit8RmqaKgkaO7or%2BMqKWgp5mjtG6%2FwKCYZqWZnLW1ec2oq2aalWKxsLrEZrCerA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-tommy-trinder-net-worth-2024-wiki-real-name-age-height-family-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>What is Tommy Trinder Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family And More</span></a>
