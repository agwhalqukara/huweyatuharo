Two, actually. As Koepka told the <a href=#>Pardon My Take</a> podcast in 2019, he was serious about hockey and baseball, until a car accident at the age of 10 changed the course of his life. "The lady that was driving, the nanny [or] whatever, ran the red light just going 45, 50 [miles an hour], T-boned this lady," he recalled, revealing, "My brother was in the backseat, I was in the front, drilled my face against the dashboard [and] broke everything in my face." That put a stop to him playing contact sports "for like a whole year and I was like, 'Alright, I'm done with hockey, I'm gonna take golf seriously [and] keep playing baseball.' And then when I figured out I wasn't good at baseball, I just kept playing golf," he quipped.</p><p dir=ltr>It all worked out, but Koepka may have actually been predestined to play baseball. That's because, as <a href=#>Golf</a> reported, his father, Bob, was a pitcher at West Virginia Wesleyan and his great-uncle, Dick Groat, was an MLB legend from the '50s and '60s who played 1,929 major league games. As Koepka told the outlet, "Our family are big baseball fans," but it turns out they also love golf. When Groat was ready to retire, he took everyone by surprise and opened Champion Lakes golf course in Bolivar, PA.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG9lbn14e9OrmKChk2KxpsDAoqOsZZGXvLbAjJupqKebqHqsu8Spoppn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sense-of-self-esteem.html><span>←</span><span>Sense of self esteem</span></a>
