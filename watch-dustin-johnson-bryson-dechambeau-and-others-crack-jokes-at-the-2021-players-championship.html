In fact, Jimmy Fallon has been doing this segment with tour pros for a few years now.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Here’s how it works: These players are asked to utter a random phrase that should be added to one of their replies during an official press conference. Some of the lines from this year were just hilarious!</span></p><p><span>The humor element is triggered when these PGA tour guys add the given sentence when talking about something serious.
