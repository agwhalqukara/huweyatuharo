Jeff Pelley Wikipedia and Case Update, Where Is He Now?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Jessi Toronjo lost her entire family when she was at an early age. Nothing could be more painful than losing a family at such a young age.</strong></p><p>Teens can commit juvenile crimes often. There are various reasons for them to end up being a criminal. Peer pressure, negative influences, and love affairs could lead to deadly crimes committed by teens.</p><p>A promenade dance, commonly known as prom, is a dance party for high school students. The event is typically held near the end of the school year, and students look forward to having it.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-jessi-toronjo></span>What Happened To Jessi Toronjo?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jessi Toronjo was nine years old when she lost her whole family. After the murder of her family, there were only her stepbrother and step-sister left. They went with family members on her dad’s side, and she went with family members on her mom’s side.</p><p>She ended up in Michigan to live with her grandfather. Though they wanted her to move on, she went through lots of pain and isolation. She was placed in a foster home as she ran away.</p><p>At the age of thirteen, she tried to get over the sorrow, and for the first time, Jeff called her when she was fifteen. She went to Florida to meet him and found out that he was having a nice job and had a wife.</p><p>In 2002, detectives approached her and informed her about the case reopening of her family’s murder. All those years, she was suspecting his stepfather, who committed the crime.</p><p>When the detectives told her it couldn’t be him then only Jeff came to her mind. The detectives told him they had the same opinion about Jeff. Jessi’s story is shared in the 48 Hours crime series.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeff-pelley-wikipedia-bio-and-charges-update></span>Jeff Pelley Wikipedia Bio and Charges Update<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jeff Pelley is the stepbrother of Jessi Toronjo. A couple and their two daughters were murdered in their Lakeville, Indiana, home. To bring the whole community to their worst, the murders were committed by one of the family members.</p><p>Jeff killed his parents and two sisters over prom. Luckily, Jessi, his stepsister was away, and that might have saved her life, or else Jeff might have killed her as well. She was left alive but left in pain of losing everything.</p><p>He was convicted but, the case continues to wind its way through the courts. It took 13 years to arrest him. Jessi remembers that Pelley used to be short-tempered and would fight easily.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=know-jessi-toronjo-family-death-cause></span>Know Jessi Toronjo Family Death Cause<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jessi Toronjo was at her friend’s house for a sleepover the whole week. When she returned home from her friend’s place, there was terrible news awaiting her.</p><p>She found out that her whole family had been murdered. Jessi was nine years old back then, and that was pretty much like losing everything for the nine-year-old kid.</p><p>Prosecutors said Jeff Pelley killed the whole family out of anger at not being able to drive to his prom. He was the immediate suspect when the crime took place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutMCpp56mlZl6tbuMo5ysq5liwbC%2BzqehqGWamrOnec%2Beo6WdqWLEqrfIqZydoZFirq%2BwjJyYrJ1dqr2lrdOeZLCglaeybrXSZp%2BeZZ6kxHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rahama-sadau-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Rahama Sadau Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
